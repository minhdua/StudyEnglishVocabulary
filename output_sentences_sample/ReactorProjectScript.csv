Hi everyone.
Welcome back to this tutorial.
In this tutorial we'll talk about the project reactor and the different modules that are present and project reactor.
Let's go to the home page and then check the different modules that are available and project reactor.
I have the browser open and I'm going to go to the home page of the home page.
Click on this documentation link when you go to the documentation link.
This is where all the different modules that are supported by Project reactor is available.
So if you go a little bit down.
Reactor core reactor test reactor extra.
Reactor unity.
And it has four or five more.
Our goal for this course is not to explore all the modules that are present in this project reactor for this cause we are going to explore the following modules.
I'm going to go back to the presentation and then show you the modules reactor core reactor test and reactor 90.
These are the three modules that will be covered as part of this course.
And these are the three modules which are necessary in order to build the non blocking reactive RESTful API.
Let's go ahead and explore these modules in the following tutorials but this week came to the end of this tutorial.
Thank you for watching.
