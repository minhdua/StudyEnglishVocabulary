First and foremost. Thank you so much for being my student. My name is Nelson and I'm a software engineer. I'm going to be available 24/7 depending on the time zone. So if you have any questions or suggestions please make sure to ask them and I'll be more than happy to assist you or make changes according to your needs. This course is packed with awesome content and what I want you to do is to sit back relax and practice as I explain because that's the best way to learn any programming language or framework that you come across. And I've also added some exercises for you to practice and in this way you can challenge yourself and see how much you are learning. But if you get stuck please make sure to ask and I'll be more than happy to help. In the meantime if you have Embro that's awesome. Otherwise make sure to enroll to this course in Elsy site. Join me there. See.
