Hi everyone Welcome back to this material in the territorial We are going to set up the project for this cause The first steps we are going to go to the spring initialize our website I'm going to type and start So as soon as I type the start I got the recommendation as a start dot spring dot I will I'm going t click on that So this is a website which we are going to use in order to build a base Springboard Project So the project which we are going to build it's going to be a grill project I'm going to select the griddle on the current version that I have here is two point one point two So this is a version which is the latest version when I recorded this video I'm gonna name this group name Us com dot loan reactor spring So that's a group name I'm gonna click on this switch to full version and I'm gonna name the artifac I.D. us along dash a reactive spring OK And then I'm gonna keep the package name as com dot learned reactive spring and a java version tha I'm using is Java 8 so Java 8 is a base version for Springboard 2 So now we need to select the dependencies we are going to build non blocking the API right So in that case we need to select the reactive verb So if we take a look at it this is a reactive verb development with Nettie and spring potlucks we'r gonna select that followed by that the DB component that we're going to use is a mongo DV going to selec a reactive Mongo DB There you go and followed by that What we're going to do we are going to select Lomborg as a dependency okay and our product We are going to select embedded Mongo DB so embittered Mongo B is for writing integration test cases Once we are done with that what we are going to do we are going to click on the Generate project butto as soon as we click on this click generate button It's going to give you a zip file So we're going to go to the location of that file There you go I'm going to unzip this one Normally when you double click on the zip file it's going to give you the folder I have a different extractor zip extractor so I'm going to click on this extract button There you go I have the project next to us I'm going to import this project into the G ardently G open when I click on the input project and I' going to go to the downloads folder and select this one and click open and we're going to use impor project from external model and then select the greater because that's the build tool that we're usin as part of this project Like next I'm going to use the use auto import and I'm gonna select the option for create directorie for empty content routes automatically and I'm gonna leave the rest of the defaults and the java versio that I'm using is Java one point eight That is a minimum that is required in order to run a springboard to project And then when I click on the finis I'm going to put it on the full screen mode There you go I'm gonna close this So it's downloading lot of different is if you take a look whether it is running a lot of backgroun processes Basically when you download those for the very first time it might take some time to download all th dependencies in order to set up the project for you In the meantime what I'm going to do is I'm going to expand this project so you see this build out griddl file right This is a file which is like a palm dart example If you are using a maven project you are welcome to use maven if you want Because on the dependency on the build tool end there is very very minimal work but you won't be touchin this file often So if you want you can use maven to to select this file zoom in a bit So these are the dependencies that we selected from the springboard initialize the page Take a look at the Mongo reactor spring but the start of a flux which is the reactive verb We have the Lombok and test gets added automatically This is the embittered Mongo D.B. And in addition to that we have something called Project reactor project reactor is a default a reactiv library that comes with spring of flux and the default server is going to be naughty I'm going to expand this section of libraries and then I'll show you the project reactor dependencie for search for Project reactor There you go We have three dependencies One is a project reactor core which has all the flux and model reactor types and other one is a reacto test That is for testing the flux and model because you cannot just write this to unit this gives us lik the V you have been writing before In order to test the non blocking sequences they have given us specific or reactive library for duc and followed by that We have this reactor 80 so this is a wrapper which is built on top of In order for anybody to understand the flux and mono reactor types We have one final task before we complete the project setup so we have this lunchbox selected right We need to enable Lomborg for this workspace The first steps you need to check whether you have the Lombok plug in click on this analogy and the select the preferences So first thing you need to go to the plugins search for Lombo so as soon as a search for long I have the Lombok plugin normally Phew I because I had it before and my work space itself If you did not have this you have to click on this browser repositories button and then you will se this one So you need to click on that there will be an install button in the place of upgrade you have to instal this and restart the in So how the Lombok plugin already available The next step is I need to enable this for this particular project How do we do it I have to search far on operatio as soon as a search phone rotation you get this option call up a new bill on rotation processors an this option will be unchecked by default So you have to check this one and then click OK Hey upload button will be enabled or you can click O by making this you are enabling the Lombok plug in for this project so you can use that as a 4G annotatio you can use all those Lombok related annotations for this project But this way came to the end of this tutorial Thank you for watching.
