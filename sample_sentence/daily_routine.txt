Hello teacher!
My full name is	VO THANH HIEN. It’s H I E N.
Today, I fell very happy and wonderful.
Now, I will talk about daily routine.
The first one, I normally get up in the morning at 6 o’clock. Then, I do exercise about 15 minutes to keep healthy. It helps me have good health. I have breakfast with my family before I go to school. It is very great.
The second one, Of course! I am a fan of studying languages in my spare time because it is very interesting. It helps me widen knowledge and know many things. Besides, when I study well, I can travel abroad and communicate with many people. It is very useful.
The last one, Absolutely yes! I am fond of going to the cinema with my friends when I have free time. It helps me relax after school time. I can watch good films with my friends. It is very wonderful.
