When I choose a place to live and study at university, in my opinion, the best choice is boarding house because of many reasons as follows.
The first one, When I live in the boarding house, I can cook many delicious foods freely that I like such as sour soup, grilled fish, seafood hot pot. I can feel very happy when I cook in the boarding house. It’s very wonderful.
The second one, thanks to living in the boarding house, I can feel comfortable when I live because I can invite my friends to my boarding house. Besides, I can go home late. I will have freedom. It’s very great.
The last one, I can keep a pet. That is my hobby because I can play with my pet when I am sad. It helps me feel relax after school time. Also, I can study well because it is very quiet. It’s very good for my study.
However, I don’t choose relative’s house and school dormitory because I feel uncomfortable and don’t have much freedom when I live there.
